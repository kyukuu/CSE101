MY FATHER WAS A KING AND THE SON OF KINGS. HE was a short man, as most
of us were, and built like a bull, all shoulders. He married my mother when
she was fourteen and sworn by the priestess to be fruitful. It was a good
match: she was an only child, and her father’s fortune would go to her
husband.
He did not find out until the wedding that she was simple. Her father had
been scrupulous about keeping her veiled until the ceremony, and my father
had humored him. If she was ugly, there were always slave girls and serving
boys. When at last they pulled off the veil, they say my mother smiled. That
is how they knew she was quite stupid. Brides did not smile.
When I was delivered, a boy, he plucked me from her arms and handed
me to a nurse. In pity, the midwife gave my mother a pillow to hold instead
of me. My mother hugged it. She did not seem to notice a change had been
made.
Quickly, I became a disappointment: small, slight. I was not fast. I was
not strong. I could not sing. The best that could be said of me was that I was
not sickly. The colds and cramps that seized my peers left me untouched.
This only made my father suspicious. Was I a changeling, inhuman? He
scowled at me, watching. My hand shook, feeling his gaze. And there was
my mother, dribbling wine on herself.
I AM FIVE when it is my father’s turn to host the games. Men gather from as
far as Thessaly and Sparta, and our storehouses grow rich with their gold. A
hundred servants work for twenty days beating out the racing track and
clearing it of stones. My father is determined to have the finest games of his
generation.
I remember the runners best, nut-brown bodies slicked with oil,
stretching on the track beneath the sun. They mix together, broadshouldered husbands, beardless youths and boys, their calves all thickly
carved with muscle.
